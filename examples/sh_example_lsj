#   Example: A forbidden transitions in Si-like 3s(2)3p(2) in LS
#            assuming the LSJ calculation has been performed

#  1.  Generate the Breit-Pauli expansion files in directory files_c.
cd files_c

          .././sh_gen-bp

cd ..

#  2. Compute the Breit-Pauli operator

 mkdir bp
cd bp
          
         .././sh_bp

cd ..

#  3.  Compute the transitions in LSJ

cd tr_lsj
       .././sh_tr_lsj
